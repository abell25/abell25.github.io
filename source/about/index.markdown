Hi, my name is Anthony Bell.  I am a software developer in the Milwaukee area.  I develop with .net technology at my job but I unusally work with linux tooling at home.  I have been studying machine learning in my free-time and now in graduate school.  I am also interesting in data mining, statistics, AI planning, and optimization (which are all related to machine learning).  I like to use cloud computing on aws when I need to spin up a cluster or a high-memory compute node or I just need a server.  The fact that all physical resources are virtualized in a cloud environment makes for some very interesting architectural possibilities, such as infrastructure as code.
